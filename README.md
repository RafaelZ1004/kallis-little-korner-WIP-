# Kalli's Little Korner

## About this project
A kid's clothing web store project built from scrap using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

This is a portfolio project demonstrating my understanding of fundamentals of front-end development. I started this project after learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I used Figma's AI to create a sample website layout and design and converted it into HTML and CSS components, but the images, colors and fonts are original and is not from Figma.

## Features

- Hero section
- Working navigation menu for product types: Sets, Pajamas, Dress, and Paint-by-Numbers
- Product Cards with hover animations
- Add to cart and favorite buttons with hover effects in each product card
- Footer section with social media links

## Design
- Layout inspired by sample created by Figma's AI
- I used canva to create the background for hero section and I will improve it later
- Colors, fonts, icons and images created independently
- Fully converted into HTML, CSS, and JS components

## Tools
- HTML5

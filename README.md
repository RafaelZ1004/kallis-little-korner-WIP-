# Kalli's Little Korner

## About this project
A kid's clothing web store project built from scrap using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

This is a portfolio project demonstrating my understanding of front-end development even without frameworks. I started this project after learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I used Figma's AI to create a sample website layout and design and converted it into HTML and CSS components, but the images, colors and fonts are original and is not from Figma.

## Features
- Nav bar with hover animations
- Hero section with CTA button directing to products page
- Category section in main page that directs to products page which automatically switches to the clicked category (i.e. Pajamas category)
- Pop up Form for inquiring in handmade clay section by clicking "Send your Design Request" button
- Wishlist panel that slides by clicking the heart button in the nav bar
- Can add and remove items in wishlist panel. Items are stored as JSON in localStorage to maintain state across page interactions.
- Smooth animated navigation menu for product types: Sets, Pajamas, Dress, and Paint-by-Numbers. The products change according to what product type is clicked
- Product Cards with hover animations
- Add to cart and wishlist buttons with hover effects in each product card
- Footer section with social media links and nav links
